# naijR 0.3.3
* Fixed repetitions in the output when multiple LGAs' spellings are corrected.

# naijR 0.3.2
* Improved on print methods

# naijR 0.3.1
* Fixed a bug that affected the proper rendering of LGA-level maps for some of the States. The approach used was to simply filter the entire data when requiring a State map, so as to reduce name clashes that occurred from synonyms amongst some of the LGAs and/or States.
* Enabled the fine-tuning of creation of `lgas` objects in the event that the argument provided is the name of an LGA that is synonymous with it's State (argument `strict`).

# naijR 0.3.0
* Provide new methods for the S3 generics `head` and `tail` to work with objects that inherit from class `regions`.
* The S3 constructors `states` and `lgas` gain a logical argument `warn` to control whether or not they issue a warning when an input string does not contain an actual State/LGA.
* General improvement of the formatting of output to enhance the user experience.
* Fixed a bug that prevented the loading of LGAs from the internal data when the package is not attached to the search path i.e. invocation with `naijR::lgas()` was producing an error.

# naijR 0.2.2
* Export S3 generic `fix_region`.

# naijR 0.2.1
* Fixed incorrect URLs, as noted by CRAN
* Edits to output message

# naijR 0.2.0
* Added a new function `is_lga`, which checks an object for Local Government Areas.
* Ignore, with a warning, the check for `is_state` when the object checked is not of type `character`.
* Draw maps up to LGA level

# naijR 0.1.5
* Built new package website.

# naijR 0.1.4
* Suppress deprecation warning for `is_state` when it is called internally by package function; displayed only when function is called directly.

# naijR 0.1.3
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Recognise abbreviations of 'Federal Capital Territory' i.e. FCT.
* Disable error-check on character type for `is_state` so it can be used more effectively for functional programming constructs.

}
\arguments{
\item{states}{A character vector with strings representing one or more
States of Nigeria. If missing, the function will return a \code{states}
object containing all the States.}

\item{gpz}{\code{NULL} (the default) or, case insensitively, one or more of
the following strings: \code{"nc", "ne", "nw", "se", "ss"} and \code{"sw"}
(see "Details").}

\item{all}{logical; whether to include the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)
in the result.}

\item{warn}{logical; issue a warning when one or more elements are not
actually States (i.e. they were misspelt).}

\item{x}{For \code{is_state} a vector to be tested. For \code{as_state}, a
string representing a State that shares its name with one of its Local
Government Areas.}

\item{...}{Arguments used for methods. See documentation of generic
for details.}

\item{i, exact}{See help file for \code{?Extract}}

\item{object}{An object of class \code{regions}}
}
\value{
The States of Nigeria as a whole or by zones, as an S3 object
of class \code{states}. \code{is_state} returns a logical vector.of same
length as the input. If the input object is not even of type
\code{character}, return the object unaltered, with a warning. In the case
of \code{as_state}, an object of class \code{states}.
}
\description{
Objects for Representing the Federal States of Nigeria
}
\details{
\code{gpz} represents a geopolitical zone which, in the Nigerian
context, is a national subdivision that groups contiguous states that bear
certain socio-cultural and political similarities. Historically, they arise
from sub-national administrative divisions known as 'Regions' that existed
at the time of the country's independence. There are at present 6 such
zones - North-Central, North-East, North-West, South-East,South-South and
South-West.

For \code{is_state}, An element-wise check of a supplied vector is carried
out. To test an entire vector and return a single boolean value, functions
such as \code{base::all} or \code{base::any} should be used (see examples).
}
\note{
\code{is_state} throws a warning, when a missing value is among the
elements. It works only for atomic vectors, throwing an error when this
is not the case or when \code{NULL} is passed to it. This design decision
was made to allow rapid iteration through data frames without interruption,
since spelling mistakes tend to be common.

\examples{
states()  # lists names of all States
states(gpz = "se")  # lists States in South-East zone
all(is_state(naijR::states()))
is_state(c("Maryland", "Baden-Baden", "Plateau", "Sussex"))

# With coercion
kt.st <- states("Katsina")  # Ensure this is a State, not an LGA.
kt.lg <- suppressWarnings(as_lga(kt.st))
is_state(kt.st)             # TRUE
is_lga(kt.lg)               # TRUE

## Where there's no ambiguity, it doesn't make sense to coerce
## This kind of operation ends with an error

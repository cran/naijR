\details{
gpz A geo-political zone, in the Nigerian 
context, is a national subdivision that groups contiguous states. 
Historically, they arise from subnational administrative divisions 
known as 'regions' that existed at the time of the country's independence.
There are 6 zones - North-Central, North-East, North-West, South-East,
South-South and South-West.

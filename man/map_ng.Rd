\arguments{
\item{region}{A character vector of regions to be displayed. This could be 
States or Local Government Areas.}

\item{data}{An object containing data, principally the variables required to
plot in a map.}

\item{x, y}{Numeric object or factor (or coercible to one). See \emph{Details}.}

\item{breaks}{Numeric. A vector of length >= 1. If a single value i.e.
scalar, it denotes the expected number of breaks. Internally, the function
will attempt to compute appropriate category sizes or fail if out-of bounds. 
Where length is >= 3L, it is expected to be an arithmetic sequence that 
represents category bounds as for \code{\link[base]{cut}} (applicable 
only to choropleth maps).}

\item{categories}{The legend for the choropleth-plotted categories. If not 
defined, internally created labels are used.}

\item{title, caption}{An optional string for annotating the map.}

\item{show.neighbours}{Logical; \code{TRUE} to display the immediate vicinity
neighbouring regions/countries.}

\item{show.text}{Logical. Apply labels to the regions of the map.}

\item{leg.x, leg.y}{Numeric. Position of the legend.}

\item{leg.title}{String. The legend Title}

\item{leg.orient}{The orientation of the legend i.e. whether horizontal or
vertical.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to \code{\link[maps]{map}}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{maps} containing the data used to draw the
map and which can be used for additional calls to \code{\link[maps]{map}} or
other similar functions (e.g. \code{graphics::plot.default}).
}
\description{
Maps of the Federal Republic of Nigeria that are based on the basic
plotting idiom utilised by \link[maps:map]{maps:map} and its variants.
}
\details{
The default value for \code{region} is to print all State boundaries.
\code{data} enables the extraction of data for plotting from an object
of class \code{data.frame}. Columns containing States are identified. The
argument also provides context for quasiquotation when providing the 
\code{x} and \code{y} arguments.

For \code{x} and \code{y}, when both arguments are supplied, they are taken
to be point coordinates. If only \code{x} is supplied, it is presumed that the
intention is to make a choropleth map, and thus, numeric vector arguments are
converted into factors i.e. number classes. Otherwise factors or any object 
that can be coerced to a factor should be used.

For plain plots, the \code{col} argument works the same as with
\code{\link[maps]{map}}. For choropleth maps, the colour provided represents 
a (sequential) colour palette based on \code{RColorBrewer::brewer.pal}. The 
available colour options can be checked with 
\code{getOption("choropleth.colours")} and this can also be modified by the user.
}
\note{
When adjusting the default colour choices for choropleth maps, it is
advisable to use one of the sequential palettes. For a list of of available
palettes, especially for more advanced use, review 
\code{RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all}

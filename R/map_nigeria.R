#' Map of Nigeria
#'
#' A basic map of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
#'
#' @details This function is essentially a wrapper to \code{maps::map}.
#'
#' @return An object of class \code{map}, invisibly; as a side-effect,
#' results in the drawing of a map of Nigeria.
#'
#' @param show.neighbours logical; \code{TRUE} to display borders of
#' neighbouring countries.
#' @param ... Further arguments for function \code{\link[maps]{map}}
#'
#' @import mapdata
#' @importFrom maps map
#'
#' @examples
#' map_ng() # Draw a map with default settings
#' map_ng(show = TRUE) # Display portions of neighbouring countries' borders
#' 
#' @return An object of class \code{maps} containing the data used to draw the
#' map and which can be used for additional calls to \code{\link[maps]{map}}.
